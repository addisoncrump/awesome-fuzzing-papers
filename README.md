# fuzzing-summaries

Summaries and relationship data for fuzzing papers.

## General Idea

Exploring relationships between papers can be hard, and it's not always easy to
find papers you know you've read and can no longer find. I have been struggling
to keep track of fuzzing papers recently and figure others are too, so I decided
to make this.

This repository contains summaries, bibliographies, and referrer/referee data
for as many fuzzing papers as I could read and summarise.
